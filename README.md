# python-study
A repository where I try various things to study Python.

A lot of examples will be based of contents from books or resources that I am learning from, 
which will be listed below. Note that unless otherwise specified, these examples will be inspired from such sources
and may differ from the original source to better suit my learning preference.

## Sources

Note: This GitHub repo is not intended to be a substitute for the original source and will never be.
These source code snippets are written to solidify the knowledge acquired from reading.
